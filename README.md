# Codes
   ~ *All my brain cells in one place*
 
Wonders do occur. At times my mind can assemble a bit of code that gets immaculate AC's.  
Now and then I see a few WA's on the screen that gazes into my spirit while I let out an immense murmur.  
In any case, all things considered, my affection for coding and programming never passes on.  
My adoration for learning and improving never bites the dust.  

This archive contains a bunch of codes from different challenges I participated in. Each challenge likewise contains a markdown with each new thing I have learnt.
