# Codes
   ~ *All my brain cells in one place*
 
Miracles do happen. Sometimes my brain can put together a piece of code that gets perfect AC's. 
Sometimes I see a couple of WA's on the screen that stares into my soul while I let out a huge sigh.
But nevertheless, my love for coding and programming never dies.
My love for learning and improving never dies.

This repository contains a bunch of codes from various contests I took part in. Each contest also contains a README file with every new thing I have learnt.
